# Outlook Script
 A script to add the function to automate the process of emailing someone a file path

This requires Python3 to be installed. 

You need to enter your own directory info in the .reg file: a path to your python executable and the .py script in this repo.

Once that's done, run the .reg file and it will appear in your context menu.
